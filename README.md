<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This repository is not being pushed to the main site, any changes that are made will be manually added to the server. Therefor, you might run into some problems running the code locally. If you will, this will be your first challenge. When you want to access your facts, make sure to fix it so it doesn't look for factsalexcodeday.php but rather factsection.php. Let us know if there are any other big things needed in setup when running locally. </p>
